* Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Java (and in object-oriented programming in general) that allows you to hide complex implementation details
  and focus on essential features of an object. 
* It helps you create more manageable and understandable code by simplifying the way you interact with objects.
* In Java, abstraction is often achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. 
  Here's a simple example to help you understand abstraction:
* Suppose we want to create a program to model different shapes, such as circles and rectangles. 
  We can use abstraction to create a common interface for all shapes, even though each shape might have different properties and behaviors.

java
Copy code
// Step 1: Define an abstract Shape class (abstraction)
abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method to get the area of the shape
    abstract double getArea();
}

// Step 2: Create concrete classes that inherit from the Shape class
class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    double getArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    @Override
    double getArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
}
In this example:

* We create an abstract class called Shape. This class defines an abstract method getArea() without providing an implementation. 
  This means that any class inheriting from Shape must provide its own implementation of getArea().
* We then create two concrete classes, Circle and Rectangle, both of which extend the Shape class. 
  These classes provide specific implementations for the getArea() method based on their respective shapes.
* Now, you can use these classes to work with shapes in a more abstract way:

java
Copy code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create instances of Circle and Rectangle
        Circle circle = new Circle(5.0);
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(4.0, 6.0);

        // Calculate and display the areas of the shapes
        System.out.println("Circle Area: " + circle.getArea());
        System.out.println("Rectangle Area: " + rectangle.getArea());
    }
}
* This code demonstrates how abstraction allows you to create a common interface for different shapes while hiding the implementation details
  specific to each shape. 
* Abstraction helps you focus on the essential properties and behaviors of objects, making your code more organized and easier to maintain.

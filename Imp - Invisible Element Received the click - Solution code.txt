for e.g. here in below example Loginbutton was not clickable

note -> We should not used javascriptexecutor unless and until it is hard need 



// If any invisible element received the click and in Console we are getting an error that different element received the click
   then we can try below code for e.g. Preloader received the click then in console it will also mentioned that which element 
   received the click so, we can use that locators to close that element through selenium code like below

  
  boolean invisible=wait.until(ExpectedConditions.invisiblilityOfElementLocated(By.id("Preloader"))); // 
<- this is boolean condition we can put for invisibility of element
  if (invisible) {
		 WebElement Loginbutton =driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@value='Login']));
                 LoginButton.Click();
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Another way to handle the Element not clickable is Javascript executor as below

JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
WebElement Loginbutton =driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@value='Login']));
js.executeScript("argument[0].click();", loginButton);
